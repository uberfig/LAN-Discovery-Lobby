this project is now completed and I will put a compiled demo on itch
=============

This project is the lobby system from the [Bomberman demo](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/139) combined with the [lan discovery plugin](https://github.com/Wavesonics/LANServerBroadcast) made to be plug-and-play to aid in learning Godot's networking capabilities
